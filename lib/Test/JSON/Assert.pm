=head1 NAME

Test::JSON::Assert - Tests JPaths into an JSON Data structure for correct values/matches

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::JSON::Assert tests => 2;

 my $xml1 = "<foo xmlns="urn:message"><bar baz="buzz">text</bar></foo>";
 my $xml2 = "<f:foo xmlns:f="urn:message"><f:bar baz="buzz">text</f:bar></f:foo>";
 my $xml3 = "<foo><bar baz="buzz">text</bar></foo>";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to test if two JSON data structures are semantically the
same.

It uses JSON::Assert to do all of it's checking.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

In all of the following subroutines there are three common parameters.

C<$doc> is a data structure generated from a JSON document.

C<$jpath> is a string which contains the path to the element(s) you'd like to
match against, whether this is for a count or a value match.

=over 4

=item is_jpath_count($doc, $jpath, $count, $name)

Test passes if there are $count keys referenced by $jpath in the $doc.

C<$count> is the number of expected keys which match the C<$jpath>.

=item does_jpath_value_match($doc, $jpath, $match, $name)

Test passes if C<$jpath> matches only one key in C<$doc> and the value
matched smart matches against C<$match>.

Again, C<$match> can be a scalar, regex, arrayref or anything the smart match
operator can match on.

=item do_jpath_values_match($doc, $jpath, $match, $name)

Test passes if C<$jpath> matches at least one key in C<$doc> and all nodes
matched smart matches against C<$match>.

Again, C<$match> can be a scalar, regex, arrayref or anything the smart match
operator can match on.
